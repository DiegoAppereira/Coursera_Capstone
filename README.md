This file, and other associated files, make up my contribution to the final Peer Reviewed Assignment for the Coursera Capstone Project for Applied Data Science Capstone. This was my final module in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program.

For reference I include the original definition for each part of the assignment.
Part 1

I Am Describe below my project and original project.
By Diego A Pereira.


# Section 1: Introduction/Business Problem


Business Scenario for Turism
A lot of Turist have plans to travel to london does not matter the month or day always need make your choices about where you will visit and eat during you travel.

On my example have some turists trying find a good restaurant to eat but they are finding thesame restaurants like Japanese or Italian.
But you know that far from you, that a good places to go but need walk for a long time or  search on web sites to bring you to the best restaurants.

Also the last time you went to london a 2 year ago your favority restaurant is closed and another japanese opened.
  
So the ideia here is use the Capstone Project to show what is the most popular restautant by venue and location data from FourSquare,  where i will get what is the most popular, what is the distance of the tourism spot on this example i will use convent Garden, all the data will be generate a graphics showing map and graphics what is the best place to open a new restaurant.
    
A high level approach is as follows:

1. Where is the location for open new restaurant ? 
2. What is popular food for tour or resident ?
3. How many is restaurant around Covent Garden and into Covent Garden?
4. How many kind of restaurant around Covent Garden?

Some examples of tourism spot:

   London Bridge
   convent Garden - i will use this spot.

I am using to project some itens important to my project (Data acquisition, data Cleansing, data analysis, and data visualization)

Now that the we know what is the problem Lets See about the Data Section and how we can get all the information needed.

# Section 2: Data Methodology:
Here my ideia and original ideia is describe what data is better to resolve the previously problem with turism.

the data below will be used on the next week 2 
1. Data number of restaurant around Covent Garden?
2. Data location restaurant around Covent Garden?
3. Data number of tourist or local residents on Covent Garden (effect to size of restaurant) ?. 
4. Data kind of popular food from Covent Garden?
5. Trends of demands food from Covent Garden? 

I will use foursquare and notebook for this project.

The next part is the week2 of capstone Project.
